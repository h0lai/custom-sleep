# custom-sleep
This Rust utility provides a novel approach to enhancing the security of applications by encrypting the stack during runtime. It utilizes the Windows API to manipulate memory permissions and to encrypt the stack contents before entering a sleep state. This method ensures that sensitive information stored in the stack is protected against unauthorized access and tampering.

Features

Runtime Stack Encryption: Encrypts the application's stack with a strong encryption algorithm to protect against data leaks and unauthorized access.
Windows API Integration: Makes use of the Windows API for memory management and thread manipulation, ensuring compatibility and efficiency on Windows platforms.
Customizable Encryption: Includes a simple XOR-based encryption example, with the flexibility to implement any strong encryption algorithm according to specific security requirements.
Thread-Safe Communication: Utilizes Rust's powerful concurrency features, such as channels and threads, to safely communicate between the main thread and the encryption thread.

Usage

The utility is designed to be integrated into Rust applications that require an additional layer of security. It provides a sleep_with_encryption function that replaces the standard sleep functionality, adding stack encryption before entering the sleep state.

Integration: Copy the provided code into your Rust project.
Customization: Implement your strong encryption algorithm in the encrypt_stack function.
Execution: Replace standard sleep calls with sleep_with_encryption to ensure that the stack is encrypted during sleep periods.

Example

###fn main() {
    // Encrypt the stack and sleep for 1000 milliseconds
    sleep_with_encryption(1000, |len| println!("Stack encrypted with length: {}", len));
}###

This example demonstrates how to integrate the stack encryption utility into a Rust application, providing an extra layer of security during sleep periods.
